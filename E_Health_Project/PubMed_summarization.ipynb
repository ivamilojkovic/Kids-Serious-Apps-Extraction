Although some treatment programs are partially successful in enhancing aggression regulation and reducing recidivism among specific subgroups, generalizable conclusions on the effectiveness of these interventions cannot be drawn to date. In forensic outpatient care, low treatment adherence and a predominant focus on cognitive control in most treatment programs may entail some of the factors impeding treatment. Technology-based interventions may address some of these treatment challenges.The aim of this study is to explore whether a new technology-based biocueing intervention, the Sense-IT app, can be a valuable addition to aggression regulation treatment programs in forensic outpatient care. The Sense-IT app, which provides the user with real-time physiological feedback and behavioral support, is developed to strengthen emotional awareness and facilitate real-life practice. In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate an updated version of the Sense-IT app that is suitable for forensic outpatients with aggressive behavior.First, we conducted a design study to assess the attitudes of forensic professionals and patients toward biocueing and to collect requirements for a biocueing app for this specific population. On the basis of this information, we developed an updated version of the Sense-IT app. In an evaluation study, 10 forensic outpatients used the app for 2 weeks. The app's acceptability, usability, and clinical outcomes (aggression, anger, and recognition of bodily signals related to anger) were measured before and after the intervention using both quantitative and qualitative measures.The design study revealed a cautiously positive attitude toward the use of biocueing as an addition to aggression regulation therapy. The evaluation study among forensic outpatients demonstrated moderate acceptability and adequate usability for the new version of the Sense-IT app. Exploratory analysis revealed a significant decrease in trait aggression postintervention; no significant changes were found in other anger-related clinical outcomes. To further increase acceptability and usability, a stable functioning app with self-adjustable settings, the use of smartwatches with a longer battery life, and the use of the patient's own smartphone devices were recommended.This study, which is one of the first attempts to enroll and evaluate the real-life use of a biocueing intervention among forensic outpatients, emphasized the importance of involving both patients and therapists throughout the development and implementation process. In the future, experimental studies, including single-case experimental designs using ecological momentary assessment, should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sense-IT intervention on clinical outcomes. An open attitude toward new technology, allowing exploration of the potential benefits of the Sense-IT app case-by-case, and training of therapists in using the app are expected to facilitate its integration in therapy.©Annemieke ter Harmsel, Thimo van der Pol, Lise Swinkels, Anna E Goudriaan, Arne Popma, Matthijs L Noordzij.

In a content analysis of 32 interviews with a racially diverse sample of young sexual minority men (ages 19-25; 84.4% non-White) from four regions of the USA, a majority of men (62.5%) spontaneously discussed mobile apps (e.g., Grindr, Scruff) when asked about their experience of community more broadly. Men's narratives revealed engagement with intracommunity stigma related to body size, race/ethnicity, gender expression, and sexual position (e.g., bottom). Stigma related to HIV status, substance use, and social class were not spontaneously narrated in response to questions about men's experience in communities. Expressions of stigma were frequently experienced intersectionally, particularly regarding racialized stereotype expectations (e.g., \"Asian men are twinks, effeminate\"). We discuss the ways in which sexual minority men reproduce dominant ideologies related to racism, misogyny, and masculine body ideals as they engage with one another on mobile apps. To the extent that many young men rely on mobile apps for community connection, their experiences of community might serve to exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, the deleterious impact of stigma.© 2021.

Currently, the vast majority of PGHD is generated via the use of mHealth apps and wearables like \"Fitbit\" or medical devices such as a continuous glucose monitoring device. There are many benefits of PGHD including increased monitoring of children's chronic health conditions outside clinical care to supplement ambulatory clinic visits, improved health outcomes, increased patient awareness and engagement and improved patient-provider communication. When leveraged properly, PGHD can be a powerful tool in delivering safe, effective, patient centered, efficient and equitable care as outlined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM).2 The challenges that limit collection, use and acceptance of PGHD include limited access to the internet, inability to incorporate PGHD into clinical workflows, data privacy and security concerns and apprehension about accuracy and safety of mHealth apps. These issues can lead to a lack of use or compliance with devices or apps associated with PGHD. To ensure optimal health benefits, agreement to leverage PGHD should be a joint decision between the clinician and the patient/caregiver. Future steps to ensure safety and clinical relevance of PGHD include involving regulatory authorities, device manufacturers and professional bodies to develop standards for mHealth apps and wearables to promote uncomplicated PGHD integration into workflows, easy and secure sharing of PGHD. Wearable technology, medical devices and smart phone apps become more advanced and widespread among the population, there will be an increasing potential for PGHD to facilitate personalized, efficient, and collaborative care resulting in improved health outcomes for children and adolescent and young adult. More research and innovation is needed to facilitate this transition.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

UI in adolescence is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, including depressive symptoms, peer victimization, poor self-image, and problems with peer relationships. The first-line conservative treatment for UI is bladder training (standard urotherapy) that aims to establish a regular fluid intake and a timed schedule for toilet visits. The success of bladder training is strongly dependent on good concordance, which can be challenging for young people.This paper aims to describe the development of a smartphone app (URApp) that aims to improve concordance with bladder training in young people aged 11 to 19 years.URApp was designed by using participatory co-design methods and was guided by the person-based approach to intervention design. The core app functions were based on clinical guidance and included setting a daily drinking goal that records fluid intake and toilet visits, setting reminders to drink fluids and go to the toilet, and recording progress toward drinking goals. The development of URApp comprised the following four stages: a review of current smartphone apps for UI, participatory co-design workshops with young people with UI for gathering user requirements and developing wireframes, the development of a URApp prototype, and the user testing of the prototype through qualitative interviews with 23 young people with UI or urgency aged 10 to 19 years and 8 clinicians. The app functions and additional functionalities for supporting concordance and behavior change were iteratively optimized throughout the app development process.Young people who tested URApp judged it to be a helpful way of supporting their concordance with a timed schedule for toilet visits and drinking. They reported high levels of acceptability and engagement. Preliminary findings indicated that some young people experienced improvements in their bladder symptoms, including a reduction in UI. Clinicians reported that URApp was clinically appropriate and aligned with the best practice guidelines for bladder training. URApp was deemed age appropriate, with all clinicians reporting that they would use it within their own clinics. Clinicians felt URApp would be of particular benefit to patients whose symptoms were not improving or those who were not engaging with their treatment plans.The next stage is to evaluate URApp in a range of settings, including pediatric continence clinics, primary care, and schools. This research is needed to test whether URApp is an effective (and cost-effective) solution for improving concordance with bladder training, reducing bladder symptoms, and improving the quality of life.©Katie Whale, Lucy Beasant, Anne J Wright, Lucy Yardley, Louise M Wallace, Louise Moody, Carol Joinson.

In response to this, mental health apps (MHapps) are becoming available for monitoring, managing, and promoting positive mental health and well-being. Thus far, evidence supports favorable outcomes when users engage with MHapps, yet there is a relative paucity of reviews on apps that support positive mental health and well-being.We aimed to systematically review the available research on MHapps that promote emotion regulation, positive mental health, and well-being in the general population aged 18-45 years. More specifically, the review aimed at providing a systematic description of the theoretical background and features of MHapps while evaluating any potential effectiveness.A comprehensive literature search of key databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), was performed until January 2021. Studies were included if they described standalone mental health and well-being apps for adults without a formal mental health diagnosis. The quality of all studies was assessed against the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In addition, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RoB-2) was used to assess randomized control trials (RCTs). Data were extracted using a modified extraction form from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were then undertaken to address the review aims.In total, 3156 abstracts were identified. Of these, 52 publications describing 48 MHapps met the inclusion criteria. Together, the studies evaluated interventions across 15 countries. Thirty-nine RCTs were identified suggesting some support for the role of individual MHapps in improving and promoting mental health and well-being. Regarding the pooled effect, MHapps, when compared to controls, showed a small effect for reducing mental health symptoms (k=19, Hedges g=-0.24, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.14; P\u003c.001) and improving well-being (k=13, g=0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.29, P=.004), and a medium effect for emotion regulation (k=6, g=0.49, 95% CI 0.23-0.74, P\u003c.001). There is also a wide knowledge base of creative and innovative ways to engage users in techniques such as mood monitoring and guided exercises. Studies were generally assessed to contribute unclear or a high risk of bias, or to be of medium to low methodological quality.The emerging evidence for MHapps that promote positive mental health and well-being suggests promising outcomes. Despite a wide range of MHapps, few apps specifically promote emotion regulation. However, our findings may position emotion regulation as an important mechanism for inclusion in future MHapps. A fair proportion of the included studies were pilot or feasibility trials (k=17, 33%), and full-scale RCTs reported high attrition rates and nondiverse samples. Given the number and pace at which MHapps are being released, further robust research is warranted to inform the development and testing of evidence-based programs.©Mia Eisenstadt, Shaun Liverpool, Elisa Infanti, Roberta Maria Ciuvat, Courtney Carlsson.

Many of these initiatives have focused on the timing of discharges and on lowering lengths of stay, and they have met with variable success. We deployed a novel tool in the electronic health record to enhance discharge communication.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a discharge communication tool.This was a prospective, single-center, pre-post study. Hospitalist physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) used the Discharge Today Tool to update patient discharge readiness every morning and at any time the patient status changed throughout the day. Primary outcomes were tool use, time of day the clinician entered the discharge order, time of day the patient left the hospital, and hospital length of stay. We used linear mixed modeling and generalized linear mixed modeling, with team and discharging provider included in all the models to account for patients cared for by the same team and the same provider.During the pilot implementation period from March 5, 2019, to July 31, 2019, a total of 4707 patients were discharged (compared with 4558 patients discharged during the preimplementation period). A total of 352 clinical staff had used the tool, and 84.85% (3994/4707) of the patients during the pilot period had a discharge status assigned at least once. In a survey, most respondents reported that the tool was helpful (32/34, 94% of clinical staff) and either saved time or did not add additional time to their workflow (21/24, 88% of providers, and 34/34, 100% of clinical staff). Although improvements were not observed in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses, after including starting morning census per team as an effect modifier, there was a reduction in the time of day the discharge order was entered into the electronic health record by the discharging physician and in the time of day the patient left the hospital (decrease of 2.9 minutes per additional patient, P=.07, and 3 minutes per additional patient, P=.07, respectively). As an effect modifier, for teams that included an APP, there was a significant reduction in the time of day the patient left the hospital beyond the reduction seen for teams without an APP (decrease of 19.1 minutes per patient, P=.04). Finally, in the adjusted analysis, hospital length of stay decreased by an average of 3.7% (P=.06).The Discharge Today tool allows for real time documentation and sharing of discharge status. Our results suggest an overall positive response by care team members and that the tool may be useful for improving discharge time and length of stay if a team is staffed with an APP or in higher-census situations.©Angela Keniston, Lauren McBeth, Jonathan Pell, Kasey Bowden, Anna Metzger, Jamie Nordhagen, Amanda Anthony, John Rice, Marisha Burden.

Mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) are proposed for streamlining healthcare service delivery, extending care relationships into the community, and empowering those affected by prolonged medical disorders to be equal collaborators in their healthcare. This review investigates mHealth apps intended for use with GDM; specifically those powered by artificial intelligence (AI) or providing decision support.A scoping review using the novel Survey Tool approach for collaborative literature Reviews (STaR) process was performed.From 18 papers, 11 discrete GDM-based mHealth apps were identified, but only 3 were reasonably mature with only one currently in use in a clinical setting. Two-thirds of the apps provided condition-relevant contextual user feedback that could aid in patient self care. However, although each app targeted one or more components of the GDM clinical pathway, no app addressed the entirety from diagnosis to postpartum.There are limited mHealth apps for GDM that incorporate AI or AI-based decision support. Many exist only to record patient information like blood glucose readings or diet, provide generic patient education or advice, or to reduce adverse events by providing medication or appointment alerts. Significant barriers remain that continue to limit the adoption of mHealth apps in clinical care settings. Further research and development are needed to deliver intelligent holistic mHealth apps using AI that can truly reduce healthcare resource use and improve outcomes by enabling patient self care in the community.© 2021 The Authors.

However, it is unclear how the pandemic altered parents' priorities and preferences to obtain behavioral services in this setting.Between July 2020 and January 2021, 301 parents of young children in 5 pediatric sites across the United States completed survey measures on their preferences for behavioral topics and service delivery methods in primary care. The current sample was compared with a previous sample of parents (n = 396) who completed the same measures in 2018.Child self-calming was the only behavioral topic that was rated as significantly more important in the pandemic cohort in comparison with the prepandemic cohort. The pandemic cohort also reported significantly more interest in using certain media resources (e.g., mobile apps and videos) as a delivery method and less interest in group classes/seminars. After controlling for demographic differences between the samples, there was an increased preference for multimedia resources overall in the pandemic cohort, as well as a decreased preference for usual care.Parents generally endorse similar priorities for behavioral topics in primary care during the pandemic as they did before the pandemic. However, there is a clear preference for more remote and media-based services during the pandemic. Pediatric practices may consider augmenting behavioral health services with multimedia resources during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to meet parents' needs.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Mental illness is of particular concern for younger people. The WHO estimates that around 20% of the world's children and adolescents have a mental health condition, a rate that is almost double compared to the general population. One approach toward mitigating the medical and socio-economic effects of mental health disorders is leveraging the power of digital health technology to deploy assistive, preventative, and therapeutic solutions for people in need. We define \"digital mental health\" as any application of digital health technology for mental health assessment, support, prevention, and treatment. However, there is only limited evidence that digital mental health tools can be successfully implemented in clinical settings. Authors have pointed to a lack of technical and medical standards for digital mental health apps, personalized neurotechnology, and assistive cognitive technology as a possible cause of suboptimal adoption and implementation in the clinical setting. Further, ethical concerns have been raised related to insufficient effectiveness, lack of adequate clinical validation, and user-centered design as well as data privacy vulnerabilities of current digital mental health products. The aim of this paper is to report on a scoping review we conducted to capture and synthesize the growing literature on the promises and ethical challenges of digital mental health for young people aged 0-25. This review seeks to survey the scope and focus of the relevant literature, identify major benefits and opportunities of ethical significance (e.g., reducing suffering and improving well-being), and provide a comprehensive mapping of the emerging ethical challenges. Our findings provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature and offer a detailed informative basis for any stakeholder involved in the development, deployment, and management of ethically-aligned digital mental health solutions for young people.Copyright © 2021 Wies, Landers and Ienca.WiesBlancheBDepartment of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institut of Technology), Zurich, Switzerland.LandersConstantinCDepartment of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institut of Technology), Zurich, Switzerland.IencaMarcelloMDepartment of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institut of Technology), Zurich, Switzerland.engJournal ArticleReview20210906SwitzerlandFront Digit Health1017718892673-253Xadolescent and youthdigital healthdigital health (eHealth)ethicsmental healthThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.20210418202107062021102963520211030602021103061epublish3471317310.3389/fdgth.2021.697072PMC8521997Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2019 Nov 7;21(11):11631701320NAM Perspect. 2019 Oct 28;2019:34532674Int J Bipolar Disord. 2017 Dec;5(1):628155206BMC Med Ethics. 2018 Feb 23;19(1):1129475437JMIR Ment Health. 2018 Apr 23;5(2):e3229685865Nat Biotechnol. 2018 Sep 6;36(9):805-81030188521Biomed Inform Insights. 2019 Mar 05;11:117822261982908330858710J Med Internet Res. 2018 Jul 30;20(7):e1013130061092Cogn Behav Pract. 2015 Aug 1;22(3):281-29026213458Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am. 2018 Apr;27(2):133-14329502741Front Psychiatry. 2019 May 01;10:28131118908Int J Bipolar Disord. 2017 Dec;5(1):2628480484Int J Soc Robot. 2020 May 23;:1-1732837630Lancet. 2007 Sep 8;370(9590):878-8917804062J Nerv Ment Dis. 2018 Aug;206(8):662-66630020203N Engl J Med. 2020 Aug 6;383(6):510-51232283003Res Involv Engagem. 2020 Sep 3;6:5132908677Science. 2019 Jan 18;363(6424):234-23530655433JMIR Ment Health. 2019 Dec 4;6(12):e1486631799937Psychiatry Res. 2020 Jun;288:11300332315885Psychol Med. 2019 Jul;49(9):1426-144830744717Front Psychiatry. 2019 May 10;10:34431133906J Med Internet Res. 2010 Jun 18;12(2):e2220562092JAMA Psychiatry. 2020 Sep 1;77(9):891-89232242888Am J Psychiatry. 2014 Jun;171(6):683-9024700332JAMA Psychiatry. 2015 Apr;72(4):334-4125671328Nurs Health Sci. 2013 Sep;15(3):398-40523480423J Med Internet Res. 2019 Jul 22;21(7):e1286931333198JMIR Ment Health. 2020 Mar 26;7(3):e1884832213476J Can Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2016 Spring;25(2):80-627274743Psychiatr Serv. 2017 May 1;68(5):427-42928412890NPJ Digit Med. 2019 Oct 18;2:10431646184Br J Psychiatry. 2016 Oct;209(4):277-28327340111Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am. 2017 Jan;26(1):117-12427837937Br J Psychiatry. 2016 Oct;209(4):271-27227698212J Med Internet Res. 2019 May 09;21(5):e1321631094356J Affect Disord. 2019 May 1;250:163-16930856493Med Health Care Philos. 2006;9(3):377-8817033883J Alzheimers Dis. 2017;56(4):1301-134028222516J Med Internet Res. 2017 Apr 10;19(4):e10228396301\n","Articles/PubMed_34713173.xml\n","34687240202110291464-54912021Oct23Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic AssociationDiabet MedParental experiences of short term supported use of a do-it-yourself continuous glucose monitor (DIYrtCGM): A qualitative study.e1473110.1111/dme.14731To investigate the experiences of parents caring for young children with type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes using a do-it-yourself continuous glucose monitor (DIYrtCGM) in a supported setting.Exit interviews were conducted with parents from 11 families at the end of the MiaoMiao study: a randomised cross-over trial focusing on parental fear of hypoglycaemia. Technical support was provided to participants while using DIYrtCGM during the trial. A convenience sampling approach was used to recruit parents. An in-depth, semi-structured interview approach was used. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes and subthemes.Parents identified that remote monitoring enabled proactive management and that overall alarms/glucose alerts were useful. Some parents reported reductions in anxiety, increased independence for their child, and improvements in the child-parent relationship. However, parents also reported regular signal loss with DIYrtCGM, along with complicated apps and challenges troubleshooting technical problems. Despite this, nine of the 11 families continued to use the system after the end of the trial.Do-it-yourself continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was on balance beneficial for the parents interviewed. However, while access to CGM shifted the burden of care experienced by parents, burden did not significantly reduce for all parents, as the improved glycaemic control that they achieved was accompanied with the responsibility for continually monitoring their child's data. Supported use of do-it-yourself CGM may be an achievable, cost-effective option for parents caring for children with type 1 diabetes in countries without funded access to CGM.© 2021 Diabetes UK.CrocketHamishHTe Huataki Waiora School of Health, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.ElbashyMona MMMDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.KavanaghTomTTe Huataki Waiora School of Health, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.StylesSaraSDepartment of Human Nutrition, Division of Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.GallandBarbaraBDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.HaszardJillian JJJDepartment of Human Nutrition, Division of Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.WiltshireEskoEDepartment of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Otago Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.Paediatrics and Child Health, Capital and Coast District Health Board, Wellington, New Zealand.JefferiesCraigChttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-0541-6094Paediatric Endocrinology, Starship Children's Health, Auckland, New Zealand.Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.de BockMartin IMIDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.Department of Paediatrics, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.TomlinsonPaulPDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.Paediatric Endocrinology, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand.JonesShirleySDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.WheelerBenjamin JBJDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.Paediatric Endocrinology, Southern District Health Board, Dunedin, New Zealand.engLottery Health Research GrantDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of OtagoJournal Article20211023EnglandDiabet Med85008580742-3071IMcontinuous glucose monitordo-it-yourselfqualitativetype 1 diabetes2021101720210617202110212021102460202110246020211023836aheadofprint3468724010.1111/dme.14731REFERENCESThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group.
